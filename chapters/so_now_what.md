# So now what?
Once you have everything installed everything needed you can create a text shadow generator like this:


```var generator=new TextShadow("#sample");```
    
But wait?What is #sample?Every text shadow generator must be hosted somewhere in the page.So #sample is an id of an html element which will host our generator.Beware that everything inside #sample will be erased after the generator is created.
